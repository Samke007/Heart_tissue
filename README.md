# Heart_tissue

The goal of the project was to classify heart tissue images into four classes based on the rejection level. The tissues are taken from patients with transplanted heart and the rejection level tells us how likely it is that the patient's immune system will reject the heart.
Four classes are labeled as 0R, 1R, 2R, and 3R, where 0R means "rejection unlikely" while 3R means "rejection highly likely".
